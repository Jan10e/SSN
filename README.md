# Stabilized Supralinear Network

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/113469222.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/113469222)

This repo contains code for the [stabilised supralinear network](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4026108/) (SSN) to recreate the interaction between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) cells in a 2D and a 4D model. The code is used to explain noise correlation as found in [Kohn & Cohen (2011)](http://marlenecohen.com/pubs/CohenKohn2011.pdf), which is a project in collaboration with [Dr. Yashar Ahmadian](https://ion.uoregon.edu/content/yashar-ahmadian).

## Code
The algorithms are coded in both MatLab and Python. Python code is produced in collaboration with [Dr. Nirag Kadakia](https://github.com/niragkadakia).
The code contains 2D and 4D EI-networks with either rate models or voltage models.

## Getting started

Either download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jan10e/stabilized-supralinear-network/
```

Then navigate to the download folder:
```
cd /path/to/stabilized-supralinear-network
```
You will need to repeat these steps if I update the code.
